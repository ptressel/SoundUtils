SoundUtils was provided as sample code for students, when I was a teaching
assistant in a graduate networking course and the project for the quarter
was to implement networking over sound.  Since signal processing was not the
point of the project, I wrote low-level sound processing examples that
students could use intact or modify.  What's interesting here is probably
the test code in SoundUtils, which mocks out the sound system.  SoundCopy
and PlayWave are examples of using SoundUtils.  Caution: These have not been
used under the current versions of Java, Windows, or Linux.
